I am now a **Postdoctoral Researcher** in Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). I will join HUST as a assistant researcher in 2026 spring. Up to now, I have published 20+ journal and conference papers (first/co-first/corresponding authors), including Conferences: ICCV/AAAI/IJCAI/ICASSP, and Journals: IEEE T-MM/T-ITS/T-CSVT, CVIU, PR letters, and so on. In the future, I will update this _github.io_ website to make it more beautiful :)

**#Research Interests**

Focusing on image-to-point-cloud (I2P) registration in three aspects:  
(1)	Method design——Learning cross-modality feature with strong discriminability  
(2)	Generalization——Matching image and point cloud anywhere and anytime  
(3)	Applications——Real-time, robust, accurate 6 DoF localization for robotics and AR

**#News**

[2025.06.25] One paper was accepted by **ICCV 2025**.  
[2025.04.28] One paper was accepted by **IJCAI 2025**.
